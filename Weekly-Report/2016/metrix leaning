siamses network
triple network

In the development of metric learning, it is inseparable from the development of human face recognition. 
The beginning of the face verification is used to determine whether the two images are the same person. On this basis, 
there will be Siamese network. By means of paired training samples, 
the training parameters are shared by the CNN neural network. 
Paired training data include similar and dissimilar images.
